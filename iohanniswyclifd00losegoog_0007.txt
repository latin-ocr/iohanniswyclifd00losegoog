larger work, De Eucharistiae.

We know, however, by Wyclif's own confession, that he was
for a long time far from being opposed to this doctrine; nay, that
lre even taught it himself. ln a work saio* to date from 1381, he
says: “l frankly admit that 1 have long been in error as regards this
heresy of accidents without a 111111011”.ι And in De Ertcharfslia: ‘'And
though 1 once took the utmost pains to explain 'l'ransubstantiation
in agreement with the sense of the early Church, 111 1 now see that
the modern Church contradicts the Church of former times, and errs
111111111101111110”.2 Η11 researches in this tlreological field are of a
much earlier date.³ 111011οο1 his later sermons, he says: “For many
years 1 sought to learn of the Friars what the real essence of the
consecrated llost might be. They at length had the boldness to
maintain that the 11011 was nothing²’.⁴

lt was rather late that 110 rejected this doctrine. ln De Berre-
dicta 11101110110110, written before 1378, he alludes to the miracle of
transubstantiation in the Host. But his expressions are here to some
extent ambiguous. While in one place he affirms 11111 God's power
can make an accident self-existent, as is seen in the Eucharist,·'' he
states in another that this miraculous transubstantiation does not
prove that quality or inherent quantity can exist 111 1110111101101.6 ln
