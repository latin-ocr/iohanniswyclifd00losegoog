De dorriinio cirili he still holds the traditional doctrine of tran·
substantiation. “The doctrine of the ‘making of Christ's Body',” says
Lechler‚ “was obviously and naively set lorth by Wyclil', since he
says in a passage in which he describes Christ as the eternal Prophet,
Priest and King: ‘lle was a Priest when, in the last supper, He made
his own Bady-²2²¹ ln another part of the same work he uses expres·
sions that are yet more categorical: “The priest”, he says, “makes
the body ol Christ; i. e. by the words ol consecration he makes the
body ol Christro be present under· the accidents.'’² We have here the
very doctrine that Wyclif attacks in his latest works withso great
and, we may say, with so fierce animation. The points upon which
he lays most stress are, in contradiction with his former belief: r, That
the bread exists alteras before consecration, neither T ransubstantia-
tion, identification nor impanarion (as the technical theological terms
stand) taking place. 2. The body ol Christ is present in the Host
satier the consecration. Remaining bread in the natural sense even
then, it is in a figurative and sacramental sense Christ’s Body. Christ's
Body and His Blood are therefore really and ttuly present — present
in a threelold aspect, virtual‚ sacramental and spiritual — and no
change in the Host is admissible except in so sar as the elements are
not mere empty signs, but active realities. We receive Christ's body
and Blood, not only corporally and substantially, but also in a spirit·
ual.manner, by t'aith. Thereby we partake of the sacramental presence
of Christ, which is by itselfa miracle, produced by the words ol
consecration. “lt is the saith of the Cliurch”, says Wyclil, “tliat, as
Jesus Christ is at the sante time (iod and inari, so the sacrament is
at once the Body ol Christ and bread; breatl in the natural, Christ’s
⁸ body in the sacramental sense·, or, more brielly: The sacrament ol the
altar is Christ’s blood and body under the lortn ol bread and wine-'5¹
How did Wyclil come to change his religious convictions thus,
and what date may we assign to his first public announcements ol
this change?
