He first discovered that the doctrine of Transubstantiation did
not tally with the expressions used by Holy Writ. Wherever the
subject occurs, we invariably remark that the same bread which lesus
Christ took in his hands and gave to his disciples to eat, is his Body.
lt is ol real bread that Christ said: “This is Myssody”; and the pronoun
“hoc” obviously stands for the bread. ln many places the Apostle
Paul gives it that name, ll lesus said ol John the Baptist that be was
Elias, he did not ou that account cease to be John3 and when lle
says of Himself: “l am the vine”, this is to be understood, not in a
corporal„but in a figurative sense. That the brcad renrains alter con·
secration is the general tradition of the Church, is maintained by its
most weighty Doctors, persistently asserted by reason, and proved by
the very testimony of our sensas.

Wyctit, while inveighing against the ‘new’ doctrine of Tran-
substantiation, also attempted to raiae his voice against certain ‘heathen’
ideas which had found entrance into the Clrurch and were gaining
strength every ‘day3 according to these ideas, due to interested promoters,
every priest was able to ‘make’ the body ol God. The idea thara
priest could ‘malae God> appeared blasphemans to Wyclif, as Lechler
very justly observes‚¹ first, because it ascribes to the priest an
uunatural power, by which a creature gives being to his Creator, a
sinlul nrau to the Holy os Holies3 second, because it is degrading to
God to say that He, the Eternal one, can be created every day;.and
lastly, because by this doctrine the lloly Sacrament is prolaned and
the abomination of desolation reigns in high places. “The llost”, he
complains, “is worshipped, the creature instead ol the Creat0r”, lle
denounces with fervent zeal the idolatry² that talres place in the
modern chorch, where the llost is nor merely honoured, but openly
adoretl3 whereas adoration is due only to the eternal God. This
adoration os the llost is yet lurther aggravatetl by the lact that divine
honours are paid to an object which is said to be only an accident
