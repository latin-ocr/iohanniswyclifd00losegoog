without substantiality. “Worse than the F etish worship of the heathen,
who pay divine honours during the whole day to whatever object
they happen to see first, in the morning, the ‘Siga-worshippers'
regularly take for their God the accident that they see in the hands
of the priest.'' It is worse, because those who spread this idolatry
well know who is really their God.¹ He repeatedly calls them priests
of Baal, adorers of accidents, dcc.

As concerns the time at which Wyclif first began to spread his
ideas concerning the doctrine of Transubstantiation, ΜΓ. F. l). Matthew

has lately written as follows, in a manner that shows him to be ⁰

thoroughly acquainted with his subject:²

“Wyclif's first denial of the doctrine of transubstantiation is uni·
versally ascribed to the summer of 1381. The date rests on fair
authority, as it is given explicirly in the narrative of the Fasciculi
Zizaniorum, yet it has always been felt to present some difficulties.
The works of Wyclif written after he had began his attach on this
doctrine are so many and so voluminous, that it is hard to believe
they were all produced within three years and a half, during two of
which he was a paralytic. This consideration alone would weigh
little in disturbing the received chronology, but a more important
difficulty is that the account as it stands in the Fasciculi Zizaniorum
does not seem to allow time for the events that it records. The
narrative stands thus: Wyclif began in the summer of 1381 to
‘determine' on the sacrament of the altar‚³ and laid down twelve con·
clusions, in which his doctrine on the subject was fully stated. Later
he laid down other conclusions‚ of which three were afterwards
condemned. This publication led to a formal condemnation of his
doctrine by the chancellor‚ William Berton, assisted by twelve
doctors, and the condemnation was publicly proclaimed in the
school of the Austin friars, where Wyclif uras lecturing. Wyclif
refused submission and appealerl to the king, and the duke of
Lancaster coming down to Oxford imposed silence on him. ln spite of

this, on ιο May he published a confession or statement of his doctrine. ·
