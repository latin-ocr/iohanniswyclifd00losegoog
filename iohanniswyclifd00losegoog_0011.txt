VIII tumouucrrou.

“Nom as llr. Slrirley remarks,¹ in aestate must mean after
11111101, which in 1381 fell on 14 April. ε1300111111, he 111111, ‘allow
time 101 all that passed in the 1110111111> lle is content to raise the
doubt without attempting to resolve it, but it is felt so strongly by
Mr. Poole, the latest writer on the subject, that he attempts to gaio
time by making the end of the proceedings later. ‘l suspect', he
says, ‘that the actual condemnation did not take place until the
bginning of 1382.’² This suggestion is based on the uncertainty
of the dates of the chancellors, an uncertainty which, lthink‚ can
⁸ be cleared up, Among the petitions in the Rolls Office for the im-
prisonment ol persons contumacious under excommunicatiom are
many frpm the chancellor of 01110111, 111111 among them I have noted
petitions 110111 Berton 21 February 1380-81 and 6 April 1381; from
llygge 20 November 1381, 1 March 1381-81, 10 September 1382.
The office of chancellor was then tenable for 1110 years. The electioris
were held on the Thursday before Whitsunday,³ which Thursday in
1381 1011 011 May 30. 011 that day there can be no reasonable doubt
that Berton left office.

“It is, then, clearly impossible 10 make the proceedings last on ··

11110 1381, and we are again shut up into the narrow space between
Easter and ro May. But even this has to be got‘by putting a strain
upon language. The natural interpretation of 111 aestate would seem
10 be ln the summer term which began on the Wednesday after
Τ rinity Sunday,⁴ and in this case the commencement of the affair
must be referred back 10 1380. 11 11 10 be noticed that in the
manuscript (Bodley‚ 703) which alone gives the date 01 Wyclif's
confession, the date ol the year has been altered by erasure from
M⁰CCC⁰LXXX⁰I⁰ by erasing the I⁰ so as to leave 1380.5 This would
throw back 11101110 of the controversy to 1379, l should not object
to the date in 111011, 11111 11 11 impossible to attach serious weight
to such an alteration by an unknown hand.

“1 may support this contention 101 1111 earlier date by an in·
· ference from the text of the contemporary St. Albane chronicler. Hc
