gives us a chapter¹ on the various opinions of men as to tlre causes ⁸
of the rebellion of 1381. First among thern he cites the laxity of the
bishops who, knowing that Wyclif and his followers were spreading
false doctrines concerning the sacrament of the altar far and wide
among the people, did not chastise their perverse children. lt was
for this neglect above all that the archhishop was punislred, and the
lesson was pointed by his martyrdorn taking place on the day after
Corpus Ch'risti (¹4 June). There is no reason to doubt that we have
here an echo of talk that was common at the time. But the vengeance
would be swift‚ not to say hasty, which smote the archbishop on
¹4 June for not repressing heresies first prunrulgated in that summer.
lndeed‚ if we may trust the expressions of the chronicler‚ there had
been time for the new opinions not merely to win a hasty condem·
nation from an old adversary at Oxford, but to spread themselves
abroad through the country.

’ “One must not lay too much . “ ,s on such an argument as this;
but, with those already advanced‚ it is enough to overthrow the
authority of the Fasciculi‚ especially when we rernember that that
volume was not compiled till half a century later, and that even the
passages that appear to be written by a contemporary were not
penned before ¹39²· After a dozen years even an eyewitness might
easily confuse the date of the condemnation with that of the begin-
ning of the controversy.”

Wyclif‚ having once for all completely rejected the Catholi‘c
doctrine of Transubstantiation, continued to argue the matter with
unabating activity. Almost all those of his worlrs that are later than
1380, whether iu English or in Latin, whether written for the people
or for men of learning, contain repeated allusions and attacks, for
which, he says “God will give him a rich reward”.'² But his doctrine
of the Eucharist is nowhere expounded so completely and so com-
prehensively as in the present treatise, of which the following peges
contain a brief summary.
