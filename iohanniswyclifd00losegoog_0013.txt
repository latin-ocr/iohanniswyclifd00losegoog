lNTRODllCTION.

2. Contenta of tho traatisa 59, Eucharistia’.

l n considerin g the Sacrament of the Altar, we must particularly note
three points. First, the Sacrament or outward symbol in itself,¹ i. e. the
consecrated Host. Second, the Sacrament taken together with its object,
viz., the true body and blood of Christ. third, the object of the Sacra-
ment, which however is not the Sacrament: the union of Christ with
Hismmystic body, the Church. Α knowledge ol these preliminary notions
is, according to Wyctit (ch. l) absolutely indispensable, lt is only
when we properly understand this synthesis that we can appreciata
at its right valae the ‘decident-theory’ of some who say that a hog,
a dog or a ntouse, can eat our Lord, because they can eat the body
ol Christ, and consequently God.²

To such we may reply that what these animatis-eat is the con·
secrated Host, which is but the sacrament, not Christ’s body or His
blood. When a lion devours a man, it does not also deaour his soul;,
yet his soul is present in every part of his' body. lt is thus also with
the Sacrament ol the Altar;³ it is quite as really present, in a sacra·
mental, spiritual or virtual manner (sacramentaliter, spiritualiter vel
virtualiter), in every part ol the consecrated Host, as the soul is
present in the body.

Secondly, we deny the assertion of those who say that wc priests
can break the body of our Lord, llis head, throat, arms, and other
members1¹ to treat Him thus would be the most atrocious sacrilege.

We affirm, according to the ancient belief of the Church, that
such a conception is utterly false. We indeed break the mere Sacru-
ment — the consecrated Host: - but we no more break Christ's
body than we break a sunbeam in a glass or crystal vessel that is
broken.5 Such is the meaning of the lines of St. Thomas Aquinas
