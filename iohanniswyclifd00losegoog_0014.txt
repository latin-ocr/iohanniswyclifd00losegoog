in the hymn, Lauda Sion: the sacrament can be broken, as we are
taught ιο do hy the Ritual, but Christ's body is not; our senses
receive a lalse impression.

lt may indeed be objected that, if the consecrated Host were
not the bodi· of our Lord, we could neither see, nor eat, nor per-
ceire it in any vray. But here we must ohserve th ιι as there are
two kinds ol sight, eating, dte, viz, that ol the body and that of the
soul, we must admit that we do not see the body ol Christ in the

unheliel: it is a form ol idolatry hy which a most base (valde abiectal
creature is worshipped as their God. This error must he eradicated.
