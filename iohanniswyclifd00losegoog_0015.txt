idolatry. The people would soon go the length ol really adoring as
God the chalice that contains Christ's blood, or the wood on which

ο His body hangs. Our ardent devotion should not be spent on the

chalice that the priest elevates at Mass, nor to the Host that we per·
ceive, but to the Sacrament that is contained therein.¹ W ere this error
destroyed, God would be worshipped much more perlectly; it would
be known that He is present, but hidden in the sacrament. Is he not
adored with puter and truer piety in every creature that we see?

But another objection is started here. The priestly authority
would be damaged, if the privilege to <make the body and blood of
Christ’ were not admitted to exist;² or if laymen knew that luith
sees the Deity in every creature more. than in the llost, and thus
receives the body ol the ·Lord by the contemplation of His creatores.
Who would then care to hear Mass? who would hire mass-saycrs
(missantes) for large sums ol money, or take the Sacrament according
to the rites of the Church?

The answer is, that even aster the destruction of this error,
priestly power would still continue to exist, within due limits. Nothing
cao be more arr-tul than that any priest can oculte the body of the
'Lord by saying Mass.³ What the priest makes is merely the con-
secration ol the Host, which is not the body of the Lord, but only
the active sign of His presence. This consecration is certainly ol
greater importance then the consecration ofa chalice or a sacerdotal
vestment, a privilege reserved to the [lishop alone. lt suffices for the
maintenance of the priest’s authority that he should give the blessing
and consecrate or ‘make’ the sacrament, which, as the Host, though
not Christ's body, is its sign and covering. He therefore does not
make the body of Our Lord, but only the sacrament, and deserves

¹ This, says Wyclif, is the signification of the Church hymn:
Sub diversis speciebus,
Signis tantum et non rebus,
latent res eximie.

²Tercio obiciunt per hoc, quod sic vilesceret sacerdotalis potestas cnm non
habet potestatem consecrandi vel faciendi corpus Christi vel sangninem. ³h'ilril
enim horribilius qnam quod sacerdos celebrans facit vel consecrat cotidie cor-
pus Christi. Nam Deus noster non est lletts recens nec corpus sunm amitt-r
faciendum.
