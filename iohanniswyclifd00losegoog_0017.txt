llll· ⁰ INTRODUCTlON.

·in the case of spiritual nourishment, quite the contrary tales place;
the eater becomes incorporated in the members of the Church, and thus
inlesus Christ Himself. The'food is here more perfect than the eater.

The arguments adduced against this teaching, as Wyclif teaches‘
further on (pr 18) are of no value whatever. ln the first place there
are some that say: As one man knows another man by the force of
a certain interior vital movement, although he only sees his garments;
'so by a like movement we recognize Christ in the Sacrament. But
it would follow then that we see God, or the soul; and we could
say the same of any one of our five senses; assoon as it perceives,
the vital activity of the subject perceives also, But no sense of man
can perceiveChrist's Body3 that is reserved to reason, aided by fairh.¹
lt is on that account that neither men nor aninials can discern any
difference between consecrated and unconsecratedohosts, when mixed
together; and the mind of man, no more than the perceptive faculties
of the brute, is able to apprehend the subject of the sacrament, the
body of our Lord.

Secondly it is objected that so many saints have maintained the
doctrine of our seeing, hearing, tasting and touching the Lord's body
in the sacred Host, that we must believe it to be true. But at the
very outset we find that there exist a great number of fictive miracles
concerning the Host, one of which (a very astonishing one) Wyclif
relates.² Supposing, however, that such miracles· are real, they do not
prove that the Host of which we spealt, is the Lord's body. He who
believes in such seigned miracles is not on that account a saint, on
the contrary, adoring the signs of Antichrist, he is a real idolater;
for the people might just as well be driven to worship moles or
bats, or any other creatures.
¹ lt has in these last times been maintained by learned men, and
proved by optical demonstration, that the body of Christ cannot be
