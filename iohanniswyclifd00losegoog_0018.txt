INTRODUCTION. XV

seen in the Host. And now let us ask the authors ol these lals'e
miracles whether Christ in the Host is sitting or standing, and of
what colour, quantity and quality His body is. They will answer that
all depends on the colour, form and quantity of the Host. So our,

God would be in one Host round and short, and in another long ·

and broken, and would thus be made up of accidental components
that change continually3 and thus we could male aGod lor ourselves
as we chose.¹

As it is with sight, so with hearing. The host is broken, but
Christ is not; and so ol the other senses. Cau any idea be-mor‘e
heathenish than to say thar if the elements are sour, stinking‚ or
rotten, the same adjectives apply to God? God would then be rotten
and stinking in village churches, lresh and sweet in churches ol the townl²

Awful consequences would lollow srom the doctrine ol the
bodily presence of Christ in the Sacrament. For we must then con-
clude that the perceived form, which we call the sacrament, is not the
flesh and blood ol Christ.³ Yet such is the doctrine of the Holy
Fathers: ol Ambrose, Augustine, dre. A Decretal indeed seems to
stand in the way, but we must not talte such decretals literally, but
understand the sense ol such expressions as ‘the bread is the body
of the Lord'3 which must olcourse be taken figuratively. And il some
wine has been spilt out of the chalice‚ we should not therefore
believe that Christ’s blood is spilt. Berengarius’ recantation is in
agreement with this doctrine, also many sentences of the Saints and
ol Church services.⁴ We therefore conclude from all this that the
sacrament has the form ol bread and wine, but is neither Christ nor
apart ol Him. The sacrament is the Host, and lesus Christ is hidden
therein in a supernatural manner.⁵

¹ Deus noster soret in una hostin rotundus et integer et in alia hostia ob-
longus et fractus ²Nichil paganias quam quod, putrefacta hostia, olet
licus, acesacto sacramento calicis acesceret luleus; etsie lleus noster in ecclesiis
ruralibus t'etet et acet, sed in civitatibus est sapidus atque recens. ‘llis quitus
patenter patet quod illa species sensibilis quam sacramentum dicimus non est cor-
pus Christi nec sanguis. ⁴Quotlibet sunt dicta sanctorum atque ecclesie que
docent quod illa sacramenta sensibilia non sunt corpus Christi et sanguis sed eorum
ligura. '’Sacranrenturu tanturn et non pam Clnisti est hostia corrsecrnta, sed
Christus insensibiliter absconsus est suh illu.
