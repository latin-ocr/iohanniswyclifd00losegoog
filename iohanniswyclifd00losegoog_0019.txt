ΙΙΝΤΗΟΙΜΙΕΤΙΟΝ.

“ ln the second chapter (pp. 29-53), Wyclif proceeds to answcr
the question, what the Sacrament is in reality (realiter). Some, as for
instance Thomas Aquinas, say that it is quantity, others, with Scotus,
⁸assert that it is quality; athird opinion is that of berengarius of

· ‘Iours, with which a decree of the Church of Rome is in agreement.

berengarius was of opinion that the Sacrament which is placed on
the altar during Mass becomes alter consecration not only a sacla-
ment but also the Lord’s body, and this was then the doctrine of the
whole Church.¹ It is therefore evident that the Church upheld, asan
article of faith, that the bread and wine, after the consecration of the
Eucharist, remain what they were before,

The Decretal “Ego Berengarius” tallies with physical per-
ception, with reason, and with the reaching of the holy Fathers,
Augustine, Ambrose‚ Hilary3 it is founded on Scripture, Matthew XXVI,
Mark. XIV, Lake XXII, John VI, r Corinthians XI and Acts II. The
second part of the decree might perhaps seem to be contrary to the
first, and therefore to stultify the entire recantation of berengarius,
for it says that the bread and wirte are, after consecration, nota
mere sacrament, but the body and blood of the Lord, which is broken
like it, andis perceiVable as such. '

We may answer to this, that neither the bread nor that which
was its accidental form, is the body of the Lord, as both ancient
and modern authors assert: “therefore”, the Gloss observes, “the
confession of berengarius should be rightly understood, or the new
error will be worse than the older one, already condemned· by the
Church”. And at the present time the opinion of Bercngarius, long
ago anathematized es heretical, would be accepted as orthodox.

We must take care to distinguish by a sharp line of demarcation
between what must be taken literally and what in figure. Itis literally
true that Iesus Christ is a man; and figurativcly, that “this rock was
Christ'’. It is in this sense that holy men, in the earliest times of the
Church, understood the words, “body and blood of our Lord’'.²

¹Ex istis luculenter patet quod ecclesia tunc sensit sentenciam predictam
Beringarii esse catholicam et sentenciam illi contradam esse hereticam. ²Sic
Igitur videtur sanctos ecclesie primitive et suos filios post eos intelligere per panem
. et vinum figurative corpus Christi et sanguinem.
