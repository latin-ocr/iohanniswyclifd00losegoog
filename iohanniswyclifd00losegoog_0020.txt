ln six different places the Scriptores call the Sacrament of the Alter,
bread; the Decretal and the Fathers hold the same language. Should
we not therefore adopt their conclusions and follow their logie?

Again, it is objected that the Church now believes in Tran-
substantiation. Eut that is a new invention, which the primitive
Church did not admit.¹ 1f wine and bread remain, as there is no
doubt they do in the doctrine of the early Church, how can there
be any question of a change? And what is this transubstantiation
after all? The complete change of one substance into another,
so that the accidents alone remain. Neither the matter nor the sub·
stantial form (forma substantialis) that were formerly bread and wine,
· remain: the collective substance, both matter and form, is destroyed,
and in its place there comes, beneath the accidents, the body ol Our
Lord. lt is therefore no annihilation of a substance, for it is changed
into something better, the accidents that were formerly inherent in
the bread and wine remaining as they were. lf therefore the latter
which remain are worshipped as Our Lord’s body, idolatry is com-
mitted.

This, however, was not the doctrine of the ancient Church, but
a new theory that should not command such confidence as the
older decree, which is scriptural and in harmony with reason, and
agrees better with the doctrines of primitive Christianity. “l myself‚''
says Wyclif, “once took great pains to make the doctrine of Tran-
suhstantiation harmonize with that of the early Church; but l now
see that they contradict one another, and that the modern theory is
an error.’'² This is a doctrine ol which the consequence is idolatry;
the people should be taught not to believe that those accidents
are identical with the body of Christ.

These new doctrines, he goes on to say in the third chapter
(pp. 53-83) have no foundation whatever in Holy Writ. lt is not
the worlt ol God to destroy that which He has made; yet, if tran·
