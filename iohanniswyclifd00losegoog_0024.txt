in which these words should be understood. lt sulfices that the belierer
should know that the bread and wine are figuratively Christ's body
aad blood. Α pious layman, il predestined, would be consequenrly
apriest, and bave power to make yconlicere) this Sacramenr; but the
Church has ordained, from morives thar are obvious, that priests
alone, on account ol their piety and of their holy lile, should be the
ministers ol the Eucharist' lt is true that a pious layman who never
saw a Host might receive Our Lord’s body more efficaciously than
a priest; for, in St. Augustine's words, “to receive Christ is to believe
in Him. Why then dost thou prepare thy teeth and stomachi believe,
and thou hast received llim”. Only spiritual leeding on Christ is
indispensable, and that consists in the grateful and pious contemplation
ol what Christ has suffered lor mankind.

Many are unfavourably impressed at the thought of what slight
effect would belong to the sacramental words il nothing was produced
by them, and no change made: a doctrine which is besides contrary
to the Canons of the Church, and especially to the words ol Ambrose,
who says that the bread becomes the body of Christ. But this saint
did not mean that the bread became identically Christ's body, only
its effectual representation. So this conversion destroys neither the
nature of the bread nor that of Christ's body by introducing another
material essence; it merely produces the presence ol the body ol
Christ ancl takes away from the bread its ‘chielness’, so that
all the ardour ol the worshippers is concontrated upon Christ
present.

This is the only view ol ‘conversion’ approved by St. Anrbrose3
this alone can give peace to the mind ol the priest. It is falsely
alfirmed that a perceptible change takes place in the bread, in order
to represent effectively the body ol Christ. And the man who cannot
understand this mode ol figurative speech will be able to make nothing
ol the Fathers and ol Holy Writ, even when speakingliterally.

¹ Satis estquod fideles concordent in sentencia antelinguanr, ut quod patris
ligurative est corpus Christi arvinum cius sanguis. Nullus fidelis dubitat quin lteos
posset dare laico potenciam conficiendi: sicut laicus, com posset esse sacerdos, posset
conficere3 verumtamen ecclesia racionabiliter ordinavit quod soli sacerdotes
propter religiositatem et dignitatern in moribus hoc sacramentum conficerent.
