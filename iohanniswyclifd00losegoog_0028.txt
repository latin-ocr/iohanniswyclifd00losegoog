blindness to abandon the Gospels and the Fathers, and to follow tlte
guidance of heretical decretals, which lay down asa rule that the
words “under bread and wine” should be taken to mean, not the
substance or nature, but the mere accidents. None of the Saints could
possibly have meant that the bread is radically consumed and destroyed
by the benediction and power of the words of Christ; it is rather
changed for the better. God cannot cause the destruction of such a
substance without any compensation¹ The faithful may therefore grant
that the sacrament of the Eucharist isin reality bread and wine; or,
as others say, acompound of that substance and of OurLord's body.
This aggregate is produced by the power of the Divine blessing, so that
there is nothing destroyed by the consecration of the bread and wine.²

Wyclif then refutes the difficulties proceeding from quotations
out of Anselm, Ambrose and Hugo. Anselm and the other Saints
cared less to honour the outward sign than to increase devotion to
what the sign significa, that is, Christ’s body and thus Christ Himself.³
No accident cau exist without a subject, as Augustine points out
both in his Dialogues and elsewhere.⁴ Bonaventura's theory that for
the sake of popular devotion and the reverence due to the Sacra· ’ ’
ment many things must be maintained for which we have no Scripture
warrant, is utterly inadmissible.⁵ When Augustine says that this Sacra-
mcnt is almost universally called the body of Christ, he does not
intend to suggest that this implies the destruction of the brand, or
that it does not remain in its essence. When anew Pope is elected,
he takes a new name3 the former man is not destroyed, but lost
sight of.⁰ And if it be objected that many Saints have believed in

¹ Deus non posset destruere tantam substanciam partem mundi sine recom-
pensacione facta aliunde. ² Nec unquam concessit iste vel aliquis ex hoc sanctus
quod benediccione et virtute verborum Domini panis consumitur usque ad funda-
menta ³hnshelmus et alii sancti laboraverunt non ad honorem illius signi
sed ad veneracionem corporis Christi et sic Christi et sic nitebantur quod quitltiitas
substancie signantis sopiatur quoad consideracionem hominis. ¹ Unde in ctut-
tirmacionem istius sentencie allegavi augustinum superius quod accidens non potest
esse sine subiecto. ⁵Doctor Bonaventura etalii sompniant quod propter hn-
norem sacramenti et devotionem multa sunt ponenda de Eukaristia que non sunt
fundata in Scriptura. θ Homine facto papa et nomine novo imposito, non pro-
pterea nomen perditur sed sopitur.
