follow 3 false doetrine; first, 13 asserting that we see Christ’s body
with our bodily eyes, and second, as concerns impanation and
accidents.

The authority ο1 51. Thomas is contrary to the great Doctors
ol the Church, who unaminously maintain that the consecrated Host
is bread, and never 3311 ita mere accident. And this agrees with
rhe decree of Nicholas ll, long before lnnocent lll’s time, when the
Cburch still flourished in all its vigour, and the fictions ol modern
schoolmen were unknown. Those must be both blind and thoughtless
who accuse those holy men ο1 heresy, and with them the whole

3ηά to concentrate 311 our devotion on Him whom we see therein
by faithy lesus Christ. The lact that we call this sacrament bread,
would show the people that it is not the body of Christ.³ Our
opponents conceal this natural identity ol the Sacrament with breed,
