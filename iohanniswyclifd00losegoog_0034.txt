of the Decretals, which says that the Sacrament is bread and
wine?

The Doctors of the Church, Raban Maur, Augustine, John
Damascofns, whose words are quoted by Wyclif, all agree as to this
point. lt is therefore an ancient doctrine, held by these Saints, that the
form, figure and ‘species’ of bread and wine is the Sacrament; by these
three names they understand the essence or quiddityof bread and wine.¹

From what precedes it follows that the Bishops are bound,
under pain of losing their temporalities, to investigate and lind out
what the Sacrament is in itself; otherwise, they are not able to teach
the people intrusted to their care. And the others, who defend such
‘aeros’ (tales cifras) all of them run the danger of damnation. ln
concluding this chapter, Wyclif says: We find that God does not destroy
the material essence but changes it into something better, keeping
its nature intact. And who we care so much for signs, should do
so too. Christ commanda us to taste the Host, as the image of our
spiritual fond.

ln Ch. Vll (pp. 189-232) there is an attaclr upon the doctrine
of identification, by which mere bread and wine become identically
Christ's body and blood. lt was invented by Peter Lombard and has
many fallacious reasons and testimonies of Saints in its favour, if
those testimonies are to be understood from a sophist's point of view.
Against it Wyclif has seven arguments, of which we only give one,
to show his mode ofreasoning. He says: Bread and wine will not become
what they will not be. But they will not be identically Christ's
body and blood, therefore they will not become so; for if they will
be identical parts of Christ, they are so already: whatever is
about to be, is. He elsewhere puts forward the following difficulty:
This sacrament being for one person whiteness (albedo), for another,
quality, for a third, quantity, δια, each of them would be Christ and
identified with Him; thus, in one and the same Host, this identification
would cause many sacramenta, of which the number would be in·
definitely great, each of them differing in kind from the others.² There
