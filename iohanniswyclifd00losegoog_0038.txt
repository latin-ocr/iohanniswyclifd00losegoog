INTRODUCTlON. XXXVII

There is yet a difficulty concerning the power by which the
bread is changed, or aa others say, converted or consecrated, so that
it becomes a sacrament.¹

We must do away with all expressions representing ideas that'
do not agree with Scripture, and bring confusion into the Church.
That power is transitory and imperceptible; we therefore do not
know when it comes and when it goes.² Some reluse to admit that
the bread is changed, others say that it is changed in a spiritual manner
(spiritualiter), others - and these are completely in the wrong -
that its being is fundamentally destroyed; and others, that it becomes
Christ’s body alter the manner just set forth. lt is thus that we must
understand Saint Thomas, when he says that Christ’s body is present
by the transmutation ol the bread; and Heia thus present to all
believers who are gathered together in His name³ There is no other
sanctity in the Sacrament. These changes may be either rightly or
wrongly understood. Transubstantiation properly means that one
substance passes into or becomes another„ Let the heads of the Church
rest satisfied as to that meaning, the essence ol what is changed

This is the doctrine ol the Saints and the teaching ol the Church:
the transubstantiation which takes place changes nothing ol the nature
