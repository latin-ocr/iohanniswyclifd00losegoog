INTRODUC'ITON. xxxix

The doctrine of impanatIon is therefore heretical, because it
contradicts Scripture and the fathers, because the entity of bread
cannot be the entity of flesh, and also because the Church cannot,
without good and serious reasons, be burdened in matters of faith.¹

We may shorten our synopsis of Ch. VIII, because Wyclif has
already dealt with the same subject in De Apostasio, where it is
dlvided into two chapters.² It is impossible, he says, that one and
the same body can beat one and the same Instant (simulet semel)
in severaldilferent places. The question is not how a Universal or
species can be multiplied in its innumerabis individuals, but how one
and the same Individual can, numerically the same, exist separately
in distinct parts of space; just as the soul is said to exist at once
in every part of the human body, and as the faithful say that Christ
is present, in soul and body, in many churches and on many altars
at the same time. That is called the “Multiplication” of the body,
for it is asserted that the whole body of Christ is at every point of
the consecrated host. There are two opposite opinions on this sub·
ject: that of Duns Scotus, who says that one and the same body can,
numerically and dimensionally, be multiplied in many places; and the
opinion of St. Thomas AquInas, according to whom it can be multi·
plied only in the following manner: in one place, spacially and
dimensionally, and in another disconnected place, potentially and
sacramentally: as Christ who exists dimensionally in Heaven, and is
present sacramentally in different places at once. After along digression
(pp. 233-268), Wyclif, returniug to the main point, acknowledges
the second opinion as the true one,³ and accordingly asserts that
Christ’s body remains in Heaven accolding to its dimensions in space,
and is by His power aud action present in the Host, as in a sIgn.⁴
As to the presence itself, there are also various opInions. One is that
Christ's body is essentially present only there, the word ‘only’ referring

¹ Cum ergo ista impanacio non hahet evidenciam ex scriptura, ex racione vel
ex testimonio dante fidem, videtur quod katholicus pro evitando periculo non dehet
impanaclonem talem asserere. ².De Apostasla, ch. VlIl, IX. ³ Sed redeundo
post disgressionem ad difficultatem tactam de multiplicacione, videtur quod secunda
sentencIa sit tenenda. ⁴ Et sic patet de corpore Christi quod est dImensionalite
ln celo et virtualiter in hostia ut in signo.
