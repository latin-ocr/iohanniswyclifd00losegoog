give it to the elergy.¹ For instance, he has wrestetl the sense of the
well-known text: For the love of God, be humble to every human
creature3 saying that it applies to the people and not to priests, whose
dignity is by far greater than that of any secular lord. Such an inter·
pretation, destroying the true sense of Holy Writ, is an attempt to
liberate the clergy from their duty of obedience, which is of such
importance to the Christian religion² Ought we not rather to believe
St. Ambrose than that pope, who usurped for himself alone the power
of the whole Church? And there are still many faithful who do nnt
acknowledge the Popes of Rome either as their pastors or as members
of the Church. “l say nothing”, adds Wyclif, “of what lnnocent did

the mendicant orders had their first beginnings, and they were the

above all, because it agrees better with Scripture, and is in greater
harnrony with the teachings ol the Fathers.³

As regards the glosses of the Fathers and the famous decrees
that were published in the spirit of the true doctrine, we may say
that no person, not even the glossator, is ιο be believed, unless he
lounds what he' asserts upon Holy Writ. He alone who has the
