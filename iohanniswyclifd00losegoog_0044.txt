Christ. Such is the sense ol the four Gospels, Ambrose‚ Jerome,
augustine and other teachers of Church laws and rites.

Our adversaries' teaching leads to nothing but idolatry. They
do not worship Christ, however, in a silver idol, like the heathen
ol Ephesus, nor even in the vilest of his creatures, but they imagine
to themselves mere accidents which they affirm are Christ, and
worship them as God, very probably lor the sake ol lucre. And il
any one speaks the truth on this matter, they stir up the people
against him.¹

Wyclil’s doctrine is least ol all obliged to recur to forced ex·
planations: this isan advantage to which he several times returns in
the best and most elevated passages of this controversy. He finally
says that the Host is to be honoured, but not adored; and honoured.

ln conclusion, he gives us a short summary ol the whole work.
As osten as a priest celebrates, he takes upon himself the obligation

to imitate Christ, to lead a lile of poverty, and to have all things ’

very last ol the priests.² ln dealing with a subject of so ⁸much
difficulty, his aim was to show that we must beware of adoring
mere signs, which are in reality cared ior only for the sake ol worldly
gain. As the worshippers of signs (cultores signorum) are utterly and
absolutely in the wrong as regards the sacramental elements, so are
they also in the wrong as concerns temporal possessions, which, to
the clergy‚ ought to be things merely accidental (accidencia)‚ in order
to gain for themselves and their people riches everlasting. And even
as those blasphemers assert that by consecration the whole essence
of bread is destroyed and absolutely annihilated, so is the effect of
our benedictione also quite destroyed. God, as the prophet says, curses
the blessings, and turns into blessings the curses of all that are opposed
to Him. By the manner in which both Confession and Communion
