L INTRODUCTION.

Maundy Thursday in the church ol St. Gallus, had asserted that
after consecration the bread still remained as belore¹

Paul of St. Castulus, preacher, spoke to the same effect,
quoting the very figure employed by Hus. He had said: “After
consecration the accidents remain with the subject iu the sacrament
ol the altar; as a man in a tunic, as the soul in the body, so God
is in the bread.” And in one of his sermons: “lt is said in the
Bible, ‘1 am the bread'; or, ‘Come, eat bread and not my body’, uc.

Andrew von Brod's statement amounts to the same. His curate
(clericus) had told him ol Hus’ prcaching that the bread remained
alter consecration. Another time llus had said: “These country
priests treat me badly, because Ι have preached that the bread
remains in the consecrated Host. And l should much like to know
what is broken, if not bread.”2 Nicholas of Podwinie told a similar
tale. The parish priest, Nicholaus ol Wsetat heard from the
‘Magister’ Hus that the bread remained alter consecration.³

Wenceslaus ol Wodicrad, notary, had several times been
present at the sermons ol Hus, who spoke alter this lashion: “Truly,
what do you see? lhave often told you” —a favourite expression of
Wyclit - “that we see Christ by laith in the bread that is elevated
by the priest. Let him but eat enough ol the bread, and he will
be fult; drink enough ol the wine, and his thirst will be quenched.⁴

Hus denied the truth of some ol these statements‚ and endea-
voured to explain others3 but his allegations are often confused and
ambiguous We should prefer to admit the testimony ol his adver-
saries, particularly as they were all on their oath. Itis, however,
admissible that misunderstandings may arise in dealing belore the
· people with matters of such dilficulty.

ll there could be any doubt that llus favoured Wyclis's doctrine
ol the Eucharist no less than his friends Stephanos Palecz and
Stanislaus of Znaim, we may refer to his treatise De Corpore Christt.⁵
