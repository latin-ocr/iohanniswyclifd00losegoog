“There are some,'’ he says, “who deny that Christ is this breed, and say
that the body of the Lord is broken, ground with the teeth, torn,
dirided into parts, eaten corporally, seen with bodily eyes, and touched
by the hands ol mera'‘

Contradicting this belief, he reaches that Christ is [νηιὰς in
favour of which doctrine be adduces agreat many Scripture quotations.
Wyclif, throughout the tirst chapter ol the tractate which bears a
similar name, attempts to prote that the body oi the Lord cannot
be broken, just as it is impossible to break a sunbeam by breaking
the glass or the piece ol crystal through which it passes tp. ru);
only the bread is broken, the Lord's body remains untouched by

our teeth (wyclist nec conterimus dentibus corpus Christi; llus:
dentibus conteri); that He cannot be seen by the bodily eye (svs-elif:
quod non ridemus in sacramento illo corpus Christi oculo corporali,
sed oculo mentali; Hus: oculis corporalibus videri). Wyclif says that
Christ is seen, norwith material, but with spiritual, vision, and Hus
uses the same expressions: Pro isto dubio est notandum quod duplex
est visio (Wyclifz est dare duplicem visionem) scilicet sensitiva et

spiritualis (Wyctih scilicet corporalem et spiritualeml.

ln the next chapter, Hus reaches that Christ is bread, hut he
does not answer in tull the question put by a Wyclil the beginning
ol his second chapter: Restat videre quid ipsum (sacramentum) sit
realiter. llis answer is: Panis est corpus Christi, horest, signum
sacramentale eius.

“l ask,'’ says llus, “why Christ is called bread eleven times in
such and such a chapter, unless to impress this heliel upon the hearts
oi the faithful.” Wyclii uses nearly the same language, examining the
passages in which Christ’s body is called bread. Hus draws most ol
the arguments lor his opinions from Wyclif. - ln the second part
ol this chapter Hus answers the question whether Christ’s body can
be broken, exactly in Wyclils manner3 aud here too he does not
take the trouble to bring together arguments from different authors,
but simply draws from Wyclil. lt would be quite foreign to the
purpose of 'this Introduction to quote every argument one by one;
it is enough to note the lact that llus has chosen, partly from the
first and partly from the second part of Wyclil’s De Eucharistia, the

arguments which he sets forth in this partos his treatise.
