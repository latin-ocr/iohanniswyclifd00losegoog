INTRODUCTlON.

24. De Antichristo
25. Dialogus.
26. 'Trialogus

Dr. llerzbergTrainckel scut us the three Vienna MSS. in one copy,
with the different collatione. The letters A, B, C, hy which l have
called the MSS. does not in any way refer to their respective value. l
l only chose this lettering because compelled to do so by the nature ¹
of the copy and collation. C's text is the best of the three MSS. in
so far as it correcte the mistaltes of the two former. The Vienna
MSS. form a separate group from those ol Prague. The numerous
mistalres of A aod B which are corrected by C, are mostly wanting
in the latter.

4. The tractate dc Eucharistiae is to be found besides in a paper
rouo us. (numerica ο) in ne aragne university Library (tvl ο. 22)
that contains: (1) Wyclif's Summa Theologica, (2) De mandatis
divinis (r3o³³-207³b) Each page is divided into two columns; there
are no marginal notes nor abstract of contents. The MS. was written
out by Andreas of Kourim (a town in Bohemia), in the years

1404—1405; forat the end of the first treatise we lind the following
words: “Et sic est finis huius decalogi feria quarta post festum sancti
Matthie apostoli sub anno domini Millesimo Quadringintesimo quinto
per manus Andree de Gourym finitus.”

5. Another MS. (E) small 4¹⁰, is also ιο be found in the
University Library (xl. E. 3) This volume contains a great many
treatiscs by many different hands, certainly of the XV¹l¹ Century.
lle Eucharistia begins on folio 15³, ending at 54³, and was copied
in a very etamped and illegible hand, in 1460 as is stated on 54³, at
the end of this treatise: '‘Amen, dac. tx⁰ dominica post Omnium Sanc·
torum Deo gracias. Explicit tractatus mayor de Eucharistia Magistri
Johannis W. Sequitur minor de Eucharistia eiusdem.” This MS. has
been described by Buddensieg, in his preface to John Vl'yclil's pole·
mical works (Leipsic 1883), pp. LlV- LVl. There are no marginal
notes in this manuscript either. One of the two Prague MSS„ E gives
thc hest and most reliablc text of all the live. l had the advan-
tage of a most careful collation ol the two last by Mr. Patera in
Prague.
